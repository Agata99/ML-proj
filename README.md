# Machine learning projects
It contains projects from my machine learning journey. I've been still learning and I regularly publish new python notebooks. Most of the projects are well described in notebook, I always write short theoretical description of algorithm and then try to solve the problem in both way - using libraries in python and code from scratch. Every notebook is the individual algorithm in its basic form.

Here is the list of projects in chronological order:
1. [StudentPerformers_DateAnalysis](StudentPerformers_DateAnalysis.ipynb) - exploratory analysis and data visualizations
2.  [Perceptron_18.06.2022](Perceptron_18.06.2022.ipynb)
3.  [Cancer_prognosis-kNN](Cancer_prognosis-kNN.ipynb)
4.  [kNN_from_scratch](kNN_from_scratch.ipynb)
